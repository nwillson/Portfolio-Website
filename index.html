                    I formerly pursued a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from WGU. With 2 years of college 
                    under my belt, I took SavvyCoders Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. I excelled, graduated, 
                    and I'm ready to begin my career.

                    While looking for Career Opportunities, I am building projects, networking at Code & Coffee St. Louis, 
                    deep-diving into MERN Stack, learning new technologies, and reading books on the matter. After obtaining a career in tech, 
                    I will return to finishing my degree to gain more knowledge.

                    <p>St. Louis is regularly rated the <b>most dangerous city</b> in the US. As someone who is new here, this was an issue. 
                        <br>
                        I am also a devoted dog owner. 
                        <br>
                        I built an application to help solve a problem for St. Louisans! </p>

                                and gives them a data-driven safety rating.

                            <br>
                            I built this application within our 12 Week Bootcamp.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The next step is to make it mobile friendly, and into a mobile application!

                        <h1>Wallpaper Application</h1>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>As practice, I pieced together two applications I built through multiple free curriculums. 
                            <br>
                            This was a weather application, and a simple to-do list. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I edited the API call to default to St. Louis, 
                            changed the conversion metrics to fahrenheit and mph, 
                            and completely 
                            <br>
                            redesigned the styling of each application. The background picture switches using keywords from user input. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I did NOT create ALL the code from scratch, 
                            but I was familiar enough with many aspects to use 
                            <br>
                            2 separate guided lectures to create one application. 
                            Together it makes a great wallpaper application! 
                            <br>

                        My girlfriend suggested I build a soundboard for the Migos.
                        <br>
                        
                        This was simply for fun and to develop my skills!
